# E-Wardrobe — Your Digital Closet

[**🇨🇳 简体中文**](./README_zh.md) | [**🇬🇧 English**](./README.md)

A modern, premium digital wardrobe application to organize your clothing collection. Upload photos, categorize items, add detailed notes, and search through your entire wardrobe with ease.

## Features

- **Image Management**: Upload and store clothing photos with drag-and-drop support.
- **Category Filtering & Management**: Organize items by type. Create, edit, and delete custom categories dynamically to fit your wardrobe.
- **Detailed Notes**: Record brand, purchase date, size, color, and free-form notes for each item.
- **Global Search**: Instantly search across brand, notes, category, color, and size fields.
- **Native Access Control**: Cookie-based Session authentication with a robust local SQLite setup. Includes a forced setup wizard, global middleware route interception, and strict complexity password enforcement.
- **Upload Security**: Employs deep Magic Bytes (file signature) validation, discarding client-side spoofed filenames and MIME types to completely eliminate executing malicious scripts (Image Trojans) hidden in upload sequences. Max 10MB dual verification.
- **Modern Light UI**: Glassmorphism, micro-animations, custom scrollbars, and a carefully crafted bright visual design system.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Built-in bilingual support with a toggle for English and Chinese (Default), saved to local storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with a custom design system
- **Database**: SQLite via [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3)
- **Storage**: Local filesystem (`public/uploads/`)
- **i18n**: Custom dictionary Implementation
